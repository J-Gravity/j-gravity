The J-Gravity project is an attempt to simulate the universe as detailed by the Janus Cosmotological Model.

To summerize, the Janus Model conceives two types of matter that have simple relationships between each other. We conceive these two types of matter as Positive Matter and Negative Matter. Positive Matter atracts other Positive Matter, and repels Negative Matter, whereas Negative Matter attracts other Negative Matter and repels Positive Matter.
